# Water Quality Predictor

**Water Quality Predictor** — an intuitive web application designed to help you monitor water quality easily and reliably.

## What does this app do?

This app uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) trained on water sample data to predict whether the water meets the required environmental standards for surface water quality.

You can enter measurements of different water parameters and instantly see if the sample is within safe limits. Every prediction is saved, so you can review past samples and observe trends over time — all in one place.

## Key Features

- **Real-time water quality predictions** based on user input.
- **History tracking** to save and revisit past predictions.
- **Visual comparison** of how water parameters have changed over time.
- Designed for easy use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Built with [FastAPI] — a modern Python framework for creating fast and reliable APIs.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier model to make predictions.
- **Frontend:** Developed using [React], a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
